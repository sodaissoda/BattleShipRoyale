Idea: Battleship battle royale

Main concepts:
- many people on 1 battleship board (>~10, depends on final size of board)
- choose starting position on board
- turn based combat
- "storm" 
- shooting at spaces with other players
- few ships per person, maybe 2 or 3 (variety of ships to choose from?)


Turns:
- round-like
- 2 actions per round (can fire one shot, relocate 1 boat)
- "storm" moves each round
-
