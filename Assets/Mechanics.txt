Idea: Battleship battle royale

Main concepts:
- many people on 1 battleship board (~>10, depends on final size of board)
- choose starting position on board
- turn based combat
- 'storm' 
- shooting at spaces with other players
- few ships per person, maybe 2 or 3 (variety of ships to choose from?)
-
